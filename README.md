This is a preliminary screening...

1. You will have 8 minutes for this exercise.

2. You are not expected to finish this test, no one has.  This is about seeing how you approach and solve the challenge.

3. You can use anything you'd normally use during this exercise (e.g. google, ask questions, the IDE...etc)

4. We want to know your thoughts so the more you talk us through what you are doing and thinking, the better.

5. You are allowed and expected to only work within the two open files.

6. Please feel free to ask questions to me/us.  We may or may not be able to answer them.
